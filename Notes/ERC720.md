- In ERC-721, there is an account for each participant that holds a balance of tokens. 
	- A mint transaction **creates** a NFT token for an owner and adds that token in the owner's account.
	- A **transfer transaction** changes the ownership of a token from the current owner to a new owner and transfer that token from old owner to new owner.

#### Assumptions

- Only one organization (org1) is allowed to create new token into their account.
- Other organizations can transfer tokens from their account to other accounts.
- Accounts can be of 2 types -
	1. Organization level
	2. Client Identity level
- Here, accounts are defined at client identity level
	- where every authorized client with an enrollment certificate(from organization) has an accountId that matches their clientId
	- therefore clientId can be considered as the accountId that is used as the payment address of a recipient


- **`MintWithTokenURI`**
	- this function first reads the certificate information of the user that submitted the transaction using **`GetClientIdentity.GetID()`** API
	- then it creates the NFT for that user

- **`TransferFrom`**
	- transfers a NFT to the recipient's account
	- it is assumed that the recipient has provided their accountId to the user who is transferring the NFT
